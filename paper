Implementation of a Smart Agriculture System in Hydroponic Lettuce Cultivation Using a Fuzzy Logic Approach
Abstractâ€” Lettuce is a hydroponic plant that requires specific conditions to achieve optimal yields, particularly soil moisture levels. Using Internet of Things Technology which can be used for automatic smart agriculture system. Fuzzy logic could help to determine irrigation based on data that is given from sensor. This research was made to develop an IoT-based system that used fuzzy logic to optimize the irrigation process in hydroponic plants, specifically lettuce. We develop two systems, namely with fuzzy logic and without fuzzy logic, then we test run with tank water, three kinds of soil and three different temperatures with parameter water usage on each condition. The result of the water usage test on dry soil was 37.96% for using the fuzzy logic and 53.02% without fuzzy logic, on the ideal soil 18.09 % for using the fuzzy logic and 35.06% without fuzzy logic, lastly on wet soil both systems not watering at all. So, we conclude that fuzzy logic makes the system more effective and adaptive to environmental situations, particularly soil moisture and temperature especially on conditions that can affect lettuce.
